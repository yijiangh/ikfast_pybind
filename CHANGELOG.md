## 0.1.0

### Added

**Available robots**
- kuka_kr6_r900 (tested)
- ur3
- ur5
- abb_irb4600_40_255
- franka_panda (tested)
- eth_rfl (tested)

Add ifkast modules for `ur5`, `kuka_kr6_r900`, `abb_irb4600`. `abb_irb4600` test fails some time randomly - need to regenerate its IKfast cpp files (might be the floating point truncation issue).

Include the upstreamed [ur_kinematics commit 6734142 July 2 2019](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot/tree/9eccd19077c2e7b853e3a3215bce9f38b77adda5/ur_kinematics).
But it seems that the old one works more stably... I will do more tests on this.
